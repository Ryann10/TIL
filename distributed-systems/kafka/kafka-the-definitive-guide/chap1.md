## Pub/Sub Messaging

Pub/sub messaging is a pattern that is characterized by the sender(publisher) of a piece of data(message) not specifically directing it to a receiver.

The publisher classifies the message, than receiver(subscriber) subscribes to receive certain classes of messages.

Pub/sub systems often have a broker.
