# 11. Container With Most Water

`Medium`

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

**Example:**

```bash
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

            for (int j = i + 1; j < heights.length; j++) {
                int min = Math.min(heights[i], heights[j]);
                int cur = min * (j - i);
                area = Math.max(area, cur);
