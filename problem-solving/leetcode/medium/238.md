# 238. Product of Array Except Self

`Medium`

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

**Example:**

```none
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Constraint**: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

**Note**: Please solve it **without division** and in O(n).

**Follow up**:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] ans = new int[nums.length];

        ans[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ans[i] = ans[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }

        int r = 1;

        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            r *= nums[i + 1];
            ans[i] *= r;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
