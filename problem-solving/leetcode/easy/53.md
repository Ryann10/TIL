# 53. Maximum Subarray

`Easy`

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```none
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

        int sum = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + sum);
            max = Math.max(max, sum);
        }
