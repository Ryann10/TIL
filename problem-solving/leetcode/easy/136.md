# 136. Single Number

`Easy`

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```bash
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            res ^= num;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
