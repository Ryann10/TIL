# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

`Easy`

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

```bash
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its depth = 3.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        return countDepth(0, root);
    }

    public int countDepth(int depth, TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int leftDepth = countDepth(depth, root.left);
        int rightDepth = countDepth(depth, root.right);

        int curDepth = Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth);

        return 1 + curDepth;
    }
}
