# 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

`Easy`

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**

```none
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        return convert(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }

    public TreeNode convert(int[] nums, int left, int right) {
        if (left > right) {
            return null;
        }

        int mid = (left + right) / 2;

        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        node.left = convert(nums, left, mid - 1);
        node.right = convert(nums, mid + 1, right);

        return node;
    }
}
