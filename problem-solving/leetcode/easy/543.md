# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Example:**

```bash
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \
      4   5
```

Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```java
class Solution {
    int maxLength;

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        maxLength = 0;

        countDepth(root);

        return maxLength;
    }

    public int countDepth(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int leftDepth = countDepth(node.left);
        int rightDepth = countDepth(node.right);

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, leftDepth + rightDepth);

        return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
}
```
