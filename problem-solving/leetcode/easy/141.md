# 141. Linked List Cycle

`Easy`

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```bash
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```bash
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

### First approach

Runtime: 3 ms, faster than 20.30% of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle.

Time complexity: O(n)

Memory Usage: 40.6 MB, less than 5.71% of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle.

Space complexity: O(n)

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        HashSet<ListNode> set = new HashSet();

        while(head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head)) {
                return true;
            } else {
                set.add(head);
            }
            head = head.next;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### Second approach

Used Floyd's tortoise and hare

Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle.

Time complexity: O(n)

Memory Usage: 39.6 MB, less than 5.71% of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle.

Time complexity: O(1)

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false;
        }

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head.next;

        while(slow != fast) {
            if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
                return false;
            }

            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
