# 226. Invert Binary Tree

`Easy`

Invert a binary tree.

**Example:**

Input:

```bash
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```

Output:

```bash
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

**Trivia:**
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

> Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
