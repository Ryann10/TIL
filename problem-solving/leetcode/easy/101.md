# 101. Symmetric Tree

`Easy`

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

```bash
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

```bash
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

**Follow up:** Solve it both recursively and iteratively.

class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return isMirror(root, root);
    }

    public boolean isMirror(TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        if (left == null && right == null) return true;
        if (left == null || right == null) return false;

        return (left.val == right.val) && isMirror(left.left, right.right) && isMirror(left.right, right.left);
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack();
        stack.push(root);
        stack.push(root);

        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode left = stack.pop();
            TreeNode right = stack.pop();
            if (left == null && right == null) continue;
            if (left == null || right == null) return false;
            if (left.val != right.val) return false;
            stack.push(left.left);
            stack.push(right.right);
            stack.push(left.right);
            stack.push(right.left);
        }

        return true;
    }
}
