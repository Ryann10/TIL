# On-Call

These practices show that no matter how mathematically sound an on-call setup is, you cannot solely rely on logistics of the on-call setup.

### Google: Forming a New Team

**Training roadmap**

- Administering production jobs
- Understanding debugging info
- “Draining” traffic away from a cluster
- Rolling back a bad software push
- Blocking or rate-limiting unwanted traffic
- Bringing up additional serving capacity
- Using the monitoring systems (for alerting and dashboards)
- Describing the architecture, various components, and dependencies of the services

Before going on-call, the team reviewed precise guidelines about the responsibilities of on-call engineers. For example:

- At the start of each shift, the on-call engineer reads the handoff from the previous shift.
- The on-call engineer minimizes user impact first, then makes sure the issues are fully addressed.
- At the end of the shift, the on-call engineer sends a handoff email to the next engineer on-call.

#### Maintaining Playbooks

### Evernote: Finding Our Feet in the Cloud

We classify any event generated by our metrics or monitoring infrastructure into three categories:

#### *P1: Deal with immediately*

- Should be immediately actionable
- Pages the on-call
- Leads to event triage
- Is SLO-impacting

#### *P2: Deal with the next business day*

- Generally is not customer-facing, or is very limited in scope
- Sends an email to team and notifies event stream channel

#### *P3: Event is informational only*

- Information is gathered in dashboards, passive email, and the like
- Includes capacity planning–related information
